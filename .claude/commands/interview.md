# Interview me about a new feature

read this and interview me in detail using the @AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything: technical, implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but make sure the questions are not obvious.

i will answer any and all questions you have, but let's go one at a time.

be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete.

then create or update a @SPEC.md file in the feature directory. it SHOULD NOT contain any code implementations. Method signatures are ok:
- Overview
- Requirements
- Architecture
- Components
- Data Operations
- Integration
- Testing Requirements
- Future Considerations
- Success Criteria, checkbox-based
- Items to Complete, checkbox-based
